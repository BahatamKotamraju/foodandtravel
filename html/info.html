        <h1>Kabir</h1>
     </div>
     <p>Kabir (1398–1518)[1]: 14–15  was a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint.<br> His writings influenced Hinduism's Bhakti movement, and his verses are found<br> in Sikhism's scripture Guru Granth Sahib, the Satguru Granth<br> Sahib of Saint Garib Das,[2] and Kabir Sagar.[3][4][5]<br>

      Born in the city of Varanasi in what is now Uttar Pradesh<br>, he is known for being critical of both organized religion and religions. <br>He questioned what he regarded to be the meaningless and unethical practices<br> of all religions, primarily what he considered to be the wrong practices in the Hindu<br> and Muslim religions.[3][6] During his lifetime, he was threatened by<br> both Hindus and Muslims for his views.[7] When he died, several Hindus and the <br>Muslims he had inspired claimed him as theirs.[4</p>
